# Dynamic-Tooltip
In this scripting project, I have a JSON dictionary list and within each index contains a word &amp; definition property.  The JavaScript program is meant to scan any HTML5 page, highlight any keywords that matches the word property from the JSON data and include a tooltip hover event with it's correct definition, again depending on the JSON definition property.
